note: remove the statue of the seven from the buildings, now is going to be an improvement or terrain along side waypoints
abyss can then be allowed to use inverted statues and destroy waypoints


policies:
3 tiers??
  war
  faith
  wisdom
  commerce
  nature

can only connect to certain policy and most will be only 1 per tier unless specific
war can connect to faith then t3 commerce
faith and nature are going to be mutual but requires one to be finished to go back to
wisdom can connect to either war, commerce and does not lock but makes policy costs more


faiths:
possible make it so each nation can only adopt specific faith? as of now just disabled
